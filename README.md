# OIBSIP - OasisInfobyte Data Science Internship

This repository contains the tasks completed during the OasisInfobyte Data Science Internship. The tasks involve implementing machine learning models to predict various outcomes based on different datasets.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Car Price Prediction
In this task, I built a machine learning model to predict car prices using various features such as brand, mileage, and year of manufacture. The model utilized regression techniques to predict the selling price of cars based on these features.


- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
- **Objective**: To create a model that predicts car prices based on the input features.

### Task 2: Mail Spam Prediction
In this task, I built a classification model to predict whether a given email is spam or not. The dataset contains various email features, such as the frequency of certain words and phrases, which were used to train a model to classify emails.

- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, ntlk
- **Objective**: To develop a model that classifies emails as spam or not spam based on features extracted from the emails.

### Task 3: Sales Prediction
In this task, I built a machine learning model to predict sales based on advertising expenditures across TV, radio, and newspaper. The model aims to help businesses understand how their advertising budget influences sales and forecast future sales based on advertising spend.

- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
- **Objective**: To predict sales based on different marketing channels (TV, radio, and newspaper).
